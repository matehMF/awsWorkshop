## AI-based testing Feedback Tool

Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes it possible for software to learn from experience by collecting data, comparing it to the expected output, recognizing patterns, and then making adjustments and adapting. 
To improve our UFT AI model, we need to collect more data. This data consists primarily of snapshots and explanations regarding any misidentifications.


1.	Click **AI Identification** from the UFT Toolbar to inspect a screen.

2.	Click the How is the detection link to share your feedback about AI identification.

3.	Register and login.

4.	Mark the object that was not properly identified by AI and click Send feedback.

5.	Close the Feedback Tool.
