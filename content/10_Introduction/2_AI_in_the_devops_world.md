UFT One is a natural citizen in the DevOps world. Its open architecture and CI/CD integrations support multiple testing strategies, eliminate bottlenecks, and increase efficiencies across your lifecycle. UFT One's DevOps-enabled toolchain also provides continuous testing support for open source, third-party, and Micro Focus solutions from [version control](https://admhelp.microfocus.com/uft/en/latest/UFT_Help/Content/User_Guide/UFT_SVN_Integration.htm?Highlight=version%20control) to [continuous integration](https://admhelp.microfocus.com/uft/en/latest/UFT_Help/Content/User_Guide/ci-tools.htm?Highlight=continuous%20integration) to agile management.

### Continuous Integration
UFT One integrates with Jenkins, Bamboo, and Azure DevOps Server using our plugins. These CI capabilities enable testers to detect errors early while using other tools, while also using testing as a build step and then present the results in their preferred CI tool’s user interface.

### Version Control
UFT One empowers collaboration among DevOps teams with its version control support for Git, TortoiseGit, Subversion (SVN), and TortoiseSVN—resulting in agility and efficiency gains.

### Agile & DevOps Management
UFT One also seamlessly integrates with Micro Focus [ALM/Quality Center](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/alm-quality-center/overview) and [ALM Octane](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/alm-octane/overview), enabling DevOps teams to increase traceability, visibility, and compliance across the lifecycle. Combine with ALM Octane to deliver immediate feedback of business and quality risks associated with a build across every step of your CI/CD pipelines through committed changes.
